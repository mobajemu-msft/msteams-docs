    </details>

### Add a content page to the personal tab

Create a content page and update the existing files of the personal tab application:

1. Create a new **personal.html** file in your Visual Studio Code with the following markup:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>
                <!-- Todo: add your a title here -->
            </title>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <!-- inject:css -->
            <!-- endinject -->
        </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Personal Tab</h1>
                <p><img src="/assets/icon.png"></p>
                <p>This is your personal tab!</p>
            </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Save **personal.html** in your application's **public** folder in the following location:

    ```
    ./src/public/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html
    ```

1. Open `manifest.json` from the following location in your Visual Studio Code:

    ```
     ./src/manifest/manifest.json
    ```

1. Add the following to the empty `staticTabs` array (`staticTabs":[]`) and add the following JSON object:

    ```json
    {
        "entityId": "personalTab",
        "name": "Personal Tab ",
        "contentUrl": "https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html",
        "websiteUrl": "https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}",
        "scopes": ["personal"]
    }
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** is the value that you entered in the generator for **Default Tab Name** plus the word **Tab**.
    >
    > For example: DefaultTabName is **MyTab** then **/MyTabTab/**

1. Update the **contentURL** path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** with your actual tab name.

1. Save the updated `manifest.json` file.

1. Open **Tab.ts** in your Visual Studio Code from the following path to provide your content page in an IFrame:

    ```bash
    ./src/server/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>.ts
    ```

1. Add the following to the list of IFrame decorators:

    ```typescript
     @PreventIframe("/<yourDefaultTabName Tab>/personal.html")
    ```

1. Save the updated file. Your tab code is complete.

### Create your app package

You must have an app package to build and run your application in Teams. The app package is created through a gulp task that validates the `manifest.json` file and generates the zip folder in the `./package` directory. At the command prompt, use the command `gulp manifest`.

### Build and run your application

#### Build your application

Enter the following command at the command prompt to transpile your solution into the **./dist** folder:

```cmd
gulp build
```

#### Run your application

1. At the command prompt enter the following command to start a local web server:

    ```cmd
    gulp serve
    ```

1. Enter `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/` in your browser to view your application's home page.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/homePage.png" alt-text="Default Tab" border="true":::

1. Browse `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/personal.html`, to view your personal tab.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/personalTab.PNG" alt-text="Default html Tab" border="true":::

### Establish a secure tunnel to your tab

At the command prompt exit the localhost and enter the following command to establish a secure tunnel to your tab:

```cmd
gulp ngrok-serve
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After your tab is uploaded to Microsoft Teams through **ngrok**, and successfully saved, you can view it in Teams until your tunnel session ends.

### Upload your application to Teams

1. Go to Teams and select **Apps**&nbsp;:::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/store.png" alt-text="Teams Store":::.
1. Select **Manage your apps** and **Upload a custom app**.
1. Go to your project directory, browse to the **./package** folder, select the zip folder, and choose **Open**.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/addingpersonaltab.png" alt-text="Adding your personal tab" border="true":::

1. Select **Add** in the dialog. Your tab is uploaded to Teams.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/personaltabuploaded.png" alt-text="Personal tab uploaded" border="true":::

1. In the left pane of Teams, select ellipses &#x25CF;&#x25CF;&#x25CF; and then choose your uploaded app to view your personal tab.

   Now you have successfully created and added your personal tab in Teams.
  
   As you have your personal tab in Teams, you can also [reorder](#reorder-static-personal-tabs) your personal tab.

## Create a personal tab with ASP.NET Core

1. At the command prompt, create a new directory for your tab project.

1. Clone the sample repository into your new directory using the following command or you can download the [source code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples) and extract the files:

    ```cmd
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Run a 'git status' command in your terminal of choice to confirm the sample was cloned successfully. You may need to apply the git command 'git config --system core.  longpaths true' in your administrator terminal to prevent the cloning error "Filename too long."

Following are the steps to create a personal tab:

1. [Generate your application with a personal tab](#generate-your-application-with-a-personal-tab-1)
1. [Update and run your application](#update-and-run-your-application)
1. [Establish a secure tunnel to your tab](#establish-a-secure-tunnel-to-your-tab-1)
1. [Update your app package with Developer Portal](#update-your-app-package-with-developer-portal)
1. [Preview your app in Teams](#preview-your-app-in-teams)

### Generate your application with a personal tab

1. Open Visual Studio and select **Open a project or solution**.

1. Go to **Microsoft-Teams-Samples** > **samples** > **tab-personal** > **razor-csharp** folder and open **PersonalTab.sln**.

1. In Visual Studio, select **F5** or choose **Start Debugging** from your application's **Debug** menu to verify if the application has loaded properly. In a browser, go to the following URLs:

    * `<http://localhost:3978/>`

#### Startup.cs

This project was created from an ASP.NET Core 3.1 web application empty template with the **Advanced - Configure for HTTPS** check box selected at setup. The MVC services are registered by the dependency injection framework's `ConfigureServices()` method. Additionally, the empty template doesn't enable serving static content by default, so the static files middleware is added to the `Configure()` method using the following code:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
      services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
  }
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
  {
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseMvc();
  }
```

#### wwwroot folder

In ASP.NET Core, the web root folder is where the application looks for static files.

#### Index.cshtml

ASP.NET Core treats files called **Index** as the default or home page for the site. When your browser URL points to the root of the site, **Index.cshtml** is displayed as the home page for your application.

#### AppManifest folder

This folder contains the following required app package files:

* A full color icon measuring 192 x 192 pixels.
* A transparent outline icon measuring 32 x 32 pixels.
* A `manifest.json` file that specifies the attributes of your app.

These files must be zipped in an app package for use in uploading your tab to Teams. Teams loads the `contentUrl` specified in your manifest, embeds it in an <iframe\>, and renders it in your tab.

#### .csproj

In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and select **Edit Project File**. At the end of the file, you can see the following code that creates and updates your zip folder when the application builds:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PostBuildEvent>powershell.exe Compress-Archive -Path \"$(ProjectDir)AppManifest\*\" -DestinationPath \"$(TargetDir)tab.zip\" -Force</PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-outline.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-color.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>

::: zone-end

## Reorder static personal tabs

Starting with manifest version 1.7, developers can rearrange all tabs in their personal app. In particular, a developer can move the **bot chat** tab, which always defaults to the first position, anywhere in the personal app tab header. Two reserved tab `entityId` keywords are declared, **conversations** and **about**.

If you create a bot with a **personal** scope, it appears in the first tab position in a personal app by default. If you want to move it to another position, you must add a static tab object to your manifest with the reserved keyword, **conversations**. The **conversation** tab appears on web or desktop depending on where you add the **conversation** tab in the `staticTabs` array.

``` JSON

{
   "staticTabs":[
      {
         
      },
      {
         "entityId":"conversations",
         "scopes":[
            "personal"
         ]
      }
   ]
}

```
