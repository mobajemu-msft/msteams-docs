          SharePoint Framework (SPFx) is a development model to build client-side solutions for Microsoft Teams and SharePoint. Your SPFx Teams app is hosted on Microsoft 365. It provides full support for developing and hosting your client-side SPFx solution. You can integrate your SharePoint Framework solution with:

          - SharePoint data and extend Microsoft Teams. 
          - Your business APIs secured with Azure Active Directory.

          For this tutorial, start Microsoft Teams app development with SPFx by building your first app with a tab capability.

          > [!NOTE]
          > Currently, Teams Toolkit offers only the Tab capability in a Teams app with Visual Studio Code and SharePoint Framework. The Bot and Message Extension capabilities are not available.

          </details>

          ## Prepare development environment

          After you've installed the required tools, set up the development environment.

          ### Install the Teams Toolkit

          The Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to provision and deploy cloud resources for your app, publish to the Teams store, and more. You can use the toolkit with Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, or as a CLI (called `teamsfx`).
          # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vscode)

          1. Open Visual Studio Code and select the **Extensions** view (**Ctrl+Shift+X** / **⌘⇧-X** or **View > Extensions**).
          1. In the search box, enter **Teams Toolkit**.
          1. Select **Install** next to the Teams Toolkit.

              :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/spfx-install-toolkit-vscode.png" alt-text="microsoft tool kit" border="true":::

              The Teams Toolkit icon appears in the Visual Studio Code sidebar after it's installed.

              :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/hw-teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the Teams Toolkit icon in Visual Studio Code sidebar.":::

          You can also find the Teams Toolkit on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).

          # [Command line](#tab/cli)

          To install the TeamsFx CLI, use the `npm` package manager:

          ``` bash
          npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
          ```

          Depending on your configuration, you may need to use `sudo` to install the CLI:

          ``` bash
          sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
          ```

          This condition is more common on Linux and macOS systems.

          Ensure you add the npm global cache to your PATH. This step is normally done as part of the Node.js installer.  

          You can use the CLI with the `teamsfx` command. Verify that the command is working by running `teamsfx -h`.

          > [!CAUTION]
          > Before you can run TeamsFx in PowerShell terminals, you must enable the "remote signed" execution policy for PowerShell.

          ---

          ## Set up your Teams development tenant

          A **tenant** is like a space, or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where you sideload and test your app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

          ### Enable sideloading option

          After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as sideloading. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.
            
          > [!NOTE]
          > Sideloading is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. If it isn't enabled, you will not be able to preview and test your app in Teams locally.

          Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

          Verify if you can sideload apps in Teams:

          1. In the Teams client, select **Store** icon.
          1. Select **Manage your apps**.
          1. Select **Upload an app**.
          1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

              :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/spfx-custom-new.png" alt-text="bot home" border="true":::

              > [!NOTE]
              > If Teams doesn't show the option to upload a custom app, talk to your Teams administrator.

          ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

          If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

          1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
          1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
          1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
          1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears:

              :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/spfx-microsoft-365.png" alt-text="Microsoft 365" border="true":::

          1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

          ## SharePoint Collection Site Administrator account

          Ensure that you have an Administrator account for a SharePoint Site Collection. You'll need this account at deployment for hosting. If you're using a Microsoft 365 developer program tenant, you can use the administrator account you created at the time.

          Now you’ve got all tools and set up your account. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building!

          ## Take a tour of the source code

          After project creation, you have the components to build a basic personal app. You can view the project directories and files in the Explorer area of Visual Studio Code.

          :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/app-project-files-spfx.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing app project files for a personal app in Visual Studio Code." border="false":::

          The Toolkit creates scaffolding for you in the project directory for the tab capability. 

          Among other items in this directory, the Teams Toolkit contains:

          - `fx`: App's state in the `.fx` directory.  
          - templates/resources: contains the app icons, `color.png` and `outline.png`.
          - `manifest.local.template.json`: contains the app manifest for local debug.
          - `manifest.remote.template.json`: contains the app manifest for publishing to Developer Portal for Teams.
          - `.fx/configs/projectSettings.json`: the settings you chose when creating the project.

          As you selected an SPFx Web part project, the following files are relevant to your UI:

          - `SPFx/src/webparts/{webpart}`: contains your SPFx web part.
          - `.vscode/launch.json`: describes the debugging configurations available in the debug palette.

          The account logins are shared between Visual Studio Code and the TeamsFx CLI.

          Now that the development environment is configured, you can create, build, and deploy your first Teams app.

           ---

          ## Build and run your app locally in Visual Studio Code

          To build and run your app locally:

          1. Select the **Run and Debug** :::image type="icon" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/run-debug-icon.png"::: icon from the Visual Studio Code sidebar.

          1. Select one of the following options to run and debug the app.

              - **Teams workbench (Edge)**
              - **Teams workbench (Chrome)**

                  :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/spfx-debug.png" alt-text="bot home" border="true":::

          1. Select the play button or select the **F5** key to start debugging.
              > [!NOTE]
              > When you run the app for the first time, all dependencies are downloaded, and the app is built. A browser window automatically opens and loads the SharePoint Workbench when the build is complete. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

              The Toolkit may prompt you to install a local certificate, if needed. This certificate allows Teams to load your application from `https://localhost`. 
              
          1. Select **Yes** when the following dialog appears:

              :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/ssl-prompt.png" alt-text="Microsoft 365" border="true":::

              Teams web client opens in a browser window.

          1. Select **Load debug scripts**, if you're prompted to load debug scripts before your app is sideloaded in Teams.

              Congratulations, your first app is running on Teams!

              :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/sp-app-added.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the completed app in local environment":::

              Your app should now be running. You can debug the app as any other SPFx web part (such as setting breakpoints).

          > [!TIP]
          > Try placing breakpoints in the render method of `SPFx/src/webparts/{webpart}/{webpart}.ts` and reloading the browser window. Visual Studio Code will stop on breakpoints in your code.

          <details>
          <summary>Learn what happens when you use Local Workbench for debugging your app.</summary>

          **Local workbench** is the default option to run and debug an app in Visual Studio Code. For this tutorial, it's recommended that you choose to debug your app with the Teams workbench, however, you can choose the Local workbench to explore web part layouts.

          > [!NOTE]
          > This interface is intended only for exploring how a web part may appear in a mobile or a tablet. You would need to write the code for including them in your app, and then deploy it to view them. 

          To explore web part layouts using local workbench:

          1. Select **Local workbench**, and then select **F5** to run and debug the app.
